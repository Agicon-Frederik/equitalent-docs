# Profile section

## General

Some general criteria:

- Nothing is mandatory
- For every piece of information the user can decide to share it or not
- A profile can be made in a guided way (an onboarding process) where every step can be skipped so everyone can do it at their own pace
- The guided way doesn't have to be followed. Some users might prefer just filling out the sections they want
