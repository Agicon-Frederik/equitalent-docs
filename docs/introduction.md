# What we're building

Weâ€™re creating Equi-talent: a digital hiring platform that flips the script and where companies apply to candidates, not the other way around.

## Weâ€™re building this for:

Job seekers who want to be seen as humans, not keywords
Neurodivergent people and people with a disability, who are often excluded by rigid processes
Recruiters and companies who believe in transparency, culture fit, and real collaboration
People looking for work, for volunteering opportunities, freelancers looking for jobs, ...

## ðŸ’¡ Why?

Because the traditional hiring process is broken.
Too often itâ€™s one-sided, opaque, and designed to filter out rather than invite in.

We believe the future of work starts by putting the candidate in control â€” with tools that allow them to present themselves authentically, ask the first questions, and engage only with companies that match their values.

## How?

With features like:

A Talent Pitch Gallery for personal introductions
A Culture Checkroom where companies show, not tell, what they stand for
A Reverse Interview Tool that lets candidates take the lead

ðŸ›  Weâ€™re building in public
That means sharing openly, iterating quickly, and learning as we go.

ðŸ‘‰ We especially welcome feedback from:

Neurodivergent individuals

People with a disability

Anyone currently looking for work

Recruiters, HR professionals & mission-driven companies

ðŸ’¬ Want to follow along or co-create with us? Letâ€™s talk.
This platform should work for everyone â€” and that starts by building it with everyone.
